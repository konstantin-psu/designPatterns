<H2>Singleton (2.2.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The section on "Singleton" in chapt. 5, page 127, shows an
incomplete code example.  This code has some problems.  Try to
discover the problems by coding and executing a main program 
that exercises the pattern.  Hint: you do not have to play
audioclips to detect the problems.

<H2>Singleton (2.2.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Design, code and test a class, caller a logger, to log messages to
a file.  Only one instance of this class should exist in an entire
program.  The key method of the class, log, takes a string and
appends it to a file.  Parameterize the logger with the name of
the log file and an integer verbosity level (the higher the level
the more verbose the log).  Code a driver program to test the
logger.  Obviously, you will use the Singleton pattern for your
implementation.  Would there be any advantage or disadvantage in
advoiding the creation of an object and using only static methods?

<H2>Singleton (2.2.3)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The textbook, at page 129, discusses the problems of subclassing a
Singleton class.  Would the use of the Delegation pattern yield
better code in this situation?
