<H2>AbstractFactory (2.1.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

A problem for which the Abstract Factory pattern could be useful
is discussed in <A HREF="Creational.html">problem 2.1</A>.
A partial implementation of this problem is available from package
<A HREF="../code/pattpack/account/index.html"><TT>account</TT></A>.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Extend the package <TT>account</TT> with one or more missing families
of products for problem 2.1.
<LI>
Design and code an abstract factory for problem 2.1.
<LI>
Code a test harness to create <I>users</i> of problem 2.1 
using the abstract factory.
</UL>

<H2>AbstractFactory (2.1.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The <A HREF="../code/AbstractFactory/Main.java">instructor's program</A>
for the above assignment
implements the selection of the factory.
The code exposes details of the selection.
If some details change, the instructor's code must
change as well.  This is undesirable.

<P>

You know a pattern that decouples the
instructor's code from these details.
Apply this pattern to improve the instructor's program.
Identify in your code the pattern essential elements.
Identify an <B>important</B> detail that no longer affects
the instructor's code.
