Suppose you have a matrix manipulation package with operations
as follows:

<PRE>
    public class Matrix {
        public Matrix (double [] [] entry) {...}
        public static Matrix plus (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
        public static Matrix minus (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
    }
</PRE>

Suppose also that a client expects matrix operations with a
different name, e.g.,:

<PRE>
    public static Matrix add (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
    public static Matrix sub (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
</PRE>

Design, code and execute an adapter for this problem.
