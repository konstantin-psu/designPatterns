<H2>Balking (6.3)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Design and code an applet to test a Balking pattern.  The idea is
a blank applet where the user can click.  A mouse click starts a
simple animation in which a bubble is created, grows, and slowly
fades away.  The applet reacts to a user click by creating and
animating a bubble as long as there are two or less bubbles in the
applet.  When there are three bubbles, a user click is discarded.
<P>
Balking is a rather easy pattern.  This exercise is an opportunity
to discover the most elementary aspects of an animation.
