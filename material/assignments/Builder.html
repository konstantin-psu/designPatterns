<H2>Builder (2.1.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

A program, based on the Builder pattern,
for the situation discussed in 
<A HREF="Creational.html">problem 2.1</A>
is available from the instructor,
see the solution link of this exercise
in the following <A HREF="../crossref.html">page</A>.

<P>

The instructor's program implements only the "economy" flavor of an account.  
Design and code classes for one or more account flavors
and add them to the test harness of the instructor implementation.
