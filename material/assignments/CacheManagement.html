<H2>Cache Management</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Provide a cache management facility for the values of the
expressions used in the previous exercise and measure the effect
of the cache on the evaluation time of some expressions.  Hint: a
cache is useful when the same expressions are repeatedly
evaluated.  If every expression is evaluated only once, using
a cache would actually slow down the execution.
