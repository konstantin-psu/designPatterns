<H2>Command (5.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Consider a very simple graphic editor that only knows how to draw
a square and to perform a few manipulations on the square: to set
the square color, to translate the square, and to rotate the
square.
<P>
Define a class, <I>Command</I>, to represent the above commands.  Include
"metacommands" such as history (to see previous commands), undo
(to undo previous commands) and redo (to repeat the previous
command) in your class.  Define a class, <I>CommandManager</I>, to control
the execution of all these commands.  The number of commands that
can be seen with "history" and undone with "undo" can be bounded.
<P>
Design, code and test a driver that executes a sequence of
predetermined commands interleaved by a time interval long enough
to perceive the effect of a command in the graphic editor.
