The syntax of a simple "while" language is shown below:

<PRE>
    Statement   ::= Assignment | Conditional | While | Compound
    Assignment  ::= Var := Expr
    Conditional ::= if Expr then Statement else Statement
    While       ::= while Expr do Statement
    Compound    ::= begin Statement; ...; Statement end
</PRE>

Define classes, using the Composite pattern, for representing
programs in this language.  For example, the following factorial
program

<PRE>
    begin
      fact := 1;
      while (n > 1) do
        begin
          fact := fact * n;
          n := n - 1
        end
    end
</PRE>

is constructed, using the classes you are expected to define,
by this Java declaration and initialization

<PRE>
    Statement factorial = new Compound (
        new Assignment ("fact", new Expr ()),
        new While (new Expr (), new Compound (
            new Assignment ("fact", new Expr ()),
            new Assignment ("n", new Expr ()))));
</PRE>

To simplify the code, expressions are represented by a trivial
placeholder.  Include in your classes methods to pretty print
a program.  The expected output when object "factorial" is printed
is

<PRE>
    begin
      fact := expression;
      while expression do
        begin
          fact := expression;
          n := expression
        end
    end
</PRE>
