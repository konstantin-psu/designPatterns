<H2>Delegation (1.1)</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The section on "Delegation" in chapt. 4, page 53, discusses a
situation, related to an airline reservation system, where
delegation seems more appropriate than inheritance.  Many details
of the problem are unspecified, thus there is great freedom of
interpretation.  Make reasonable assumptions for the unspecified
details of the problem and sketch its implementation in a style
similar to the Delegation code provided in the textbook's CD (also
available on-line from the instructor's web pages).
