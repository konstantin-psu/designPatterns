Design and code a program that constructs a pizza pie from its
components: crust, sauce, cheese, toppings etc.  Pizza pies come in
various styles: light, regular, gourmet, etc.  Different styles of
pizza are made with different styles of components.
Use an abstract factory for the creation of the pizza's components
according to a selected style.  The style is selected using a
command line arguments of a main program that is the client of the
factory.  Define a concrete factory for the construction of each
style of pizza.  Code a client that selects a pizza style from
a command argument, dynamically loads a concrete pizza factory
for the selected style, and constructs the required pizza.
