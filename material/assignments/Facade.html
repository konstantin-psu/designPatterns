<H2>Facade (4.4)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Design, code and test a program that provides a facade to class
BinaryTree and its InOrder iterator.  This should enforce the
"searchness" of trees, which is not ensured by class BinaryTree
and consider the possibility of new iterators for a tree, e.g.,
preorder or postorder iterators.
