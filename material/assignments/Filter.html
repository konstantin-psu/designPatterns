<H2>Filter (3.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The goal of this exercise is to extend and provide a driver to the
Filter pattern example contained in the CD ROM that comes with the
textbook.  The driver takes one argument from the command line.
This argument is the name of the file. The driver counts the
number of both words and characters in the file.  A filter to
count the number of characters (bytes) is included in the example.
Add a similar filter to count the number of word.  Hint: check the
correctness of your programs using the unix "wc" utility.
