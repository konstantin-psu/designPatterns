<H2>Flyweight (4.5)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Revisit problem 3.3 (the exercise about the 
<A HREF="Composite.html">Composite</A> pattern).
Extend the implementation of the "while" language with
expressions, which were left empty.  The abstract syntax of
expressions is

<PRE>
    Expr := Variable | Operation Expr Expr
</PRE>

where "Variable" is an identifier or a literal and "Operation" is
a familiar infix operation, such as add, sub, mul, etc.
<P>
Design, code and test two programs: one in which the objects
representing variables (and literals) are not shared and another
which adopts the Flyweight pattern and shares all occurences of
the same variable (or literal).
<P>
As in the original problem, it suffices to contruct the
representation of a program and print it.
