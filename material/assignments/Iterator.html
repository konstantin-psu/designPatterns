<H2>Iterator (4.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

This exercise is in two parts.
<P>
The first part is about implementing simple classes for <I>binary
search trees</I>. A binary tree is either a <I>Leaf</I> or a <I>Branch</I>
consisting of an <I>Element</I> (referred to as the decoration) and two
binary trees (referred to as the <I>left</I> and <I>right</I> child,
respectively). A binary search tree is a binary tree with some
additional properties: there is a total ordering on the
decorations; the children of a Branch are binary search trees; and
the decoration of a Branch follows all the decorations of the left
child and precedes all the decorations of the right child.
<P>
The second part of the exercise is about an iterator for a binary
search tree.  The iterator implements the <I>java.util.Enumeration</I>
interface, which is intended exactly for iterators.  
The iterator of many collections is generally obtained
by invoking a method, conventionally called <I>elements()</I>, of the
collection, e.g., see <I>java.util.Vector</I> and <I>java.util.Hashtable</I>.
There are many ways to iterate the elements of a binary tree.
For ease of testing, code an <I>in-order</I> iterator.
Recall that that the in-order traversal of a Branch visits
the left-child before the decoration and the right child after
the decoration.
<P>
Design, code and test a binary (search) tree class and an in-order
iterator for this class.
