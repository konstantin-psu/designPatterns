<H2>Little Language (5.3.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Design, code and test an interpreter for the "while" language
used in the 
<A HREF="Flyweight.html">Flyweight</A> pattern.  Add a new Statement to
output the result of the execution of a program.
<P>
Discuss how your implementation would change if variables were not
shared in a program.
<P>
Some authors call this pattern Interpreter.

<H2>Little Language (5.3.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

An Interpreter works on an abstract representation of a program in
a certain language.  A difficult problem is to build the abstract
representation from the concrete one.  Design, code, and test a
program based on the Little Language pattern for a little language
of expressions defined by the following syntax
<PRE>
    expr ::= addend ZERO_OR_MORE (("+" | "-") addend)
    addend ::= factor ZERO_OR_MORE (("*" | "/") factor)
    factor ::= number | indentifier | "(" expr ")"
</PRE>
You may re-use the expression classes used for exercise 5.3.1.
