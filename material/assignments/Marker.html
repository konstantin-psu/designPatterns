<H2>Marker (1.4.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Interface java.rmi.Remote is a Marker used in programs that
execute remote method invocation.  Code a simple class that
performs arithmetic operations that can be invoked remotely.
Where do you use interface java.rmi.Remote?  What happens
if your code forgets to implement/extend it?

<H2>Marker (1.4.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The section on "Marker" in chapt. 4, page 73, defines class
LinkedList.  Objects of this class store sequences of objects,
referred to as the <I>elements</I>,
that can be compared according two different criteria of equality,
== or <I>equals</I>.  The selection of one or the other criterion is set
using a Marker.  This implies that subclasses of an <I>element</I>
cannot <B>conceptually</B> override the criterion (why?).
<P>
Modify class LinkedList so that subclasses of an <I>element</I>
type can override the criterion of equality.
Discuss advantages and
disadvantages of your implementation with respect to the textbook's
implementation.  Hint: use dynamic polymorphism to select the
equality criterion to apply to the <I>elements</I>.
