<H2>Mediator (5.4)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Consider a board for the game of Othello.  The problem of deciding
whether a player can occupy a position on the board can be
delegated to the position itself or to an object that implements
a Mediator pattern.  
The mediator encapsulates how the positions interact in a move of the game.
Hence it should implement the move as well.
<P>
Design, code and test such an object.
In addition, discuss the design of a program that does not use a mediator,
but lets the positions interact with each other.
