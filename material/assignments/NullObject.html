<H2>Null Object (5.8)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Exercise 2.3 (<A HREF="ObjectPool.html">Object Pool</A>)
implements linked lists using classes Nil and Cons.
Instances of Nil are quite similar to instances of a Null Object pattern.
Recode Exercise 2.3 (<A HREF="ObjectPool.html">Object Pool</A>)
by eliminating Nil objects and using null references
in their places.  What are the advantages (and disadvantages) provided
by Null Objects in this problem?
