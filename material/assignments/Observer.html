<H2>Observer (5.6)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Design, code and test an applet with two components as follows.
Each component represents an integer value in the same range,
e.g., a slider in the range 0 to 100 and a textfield that only
takes an integer in the same range.  Connect the two components so
that they always show the same value. When the value of one component
is changed by a user action the value of the other component is
changed by the program so that the two values remain equal.
<P>
The problem can be solved by making the two components aware of
each other, but this makes them hardly reusable.  Or the problem
can be solved using an observer.  The observer looks for changes
in the value of each component and when the value of one component
changes and tells the other component to change value accordingly.
