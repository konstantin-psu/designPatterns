<H2>Prototype (2.1.4)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

A problem for which the Prototype pattern could be useful
is discussed in <A HREF="Creational.html">problem 2.1</A>.
A partial implementation of this problem is available from
the instructor in package
<A HREF="../code/pattpack/account/index.html"><TT>account</TT></A>.

<P>

To solve the the <A HREF="./AbstractFactory.html">Abstract
Factory exercise</A> you should have extended
the instructor package, coded an Abstract Factory for the problem,
and coded a test harness of the Abstract Factory.

<P> 

For this exercise, 
<UL>
<LI>
Code a Prototype pattern for the problem
<LI>
Code a test harness for your Prototype implementation, and
<LI>
Discuss the significant differences (advantages and drawbacks)
between this implementation and other factory patterns
you have coded.
