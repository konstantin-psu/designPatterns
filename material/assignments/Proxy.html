referred to as "remote proxy" creates the illusion that an object
that exists on a different machine is an ordinary local object.

<A HREF="Marker.html">Problem 1.4.1</A> to use a proxy
for the remote calculator.  What are the advantage of your
solution with respect to the solution of
<A HREF="Marker.html">Problem 1.4.1</A>?
