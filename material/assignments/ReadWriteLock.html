<H2>Read/Write Lock (6.5.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The ReadWrite Lock pattern is not trivial.  Design and code a test
harness for the implementation of this pattern provided in the CD
that comes with the textbook.  Your test harness should create a
dozen or two threads that at random intervals either read or
write a complex object (such as the position of exercise 6.1,
<A HREF="SingleThreadedExecution.html">Single Threaded Execution</A>).
Try to instrument the entire code to verify that access to read
or write is granted or denied when appropriate.

<H2>Read/Write Lock (6.5.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The textbook implementation of the ReadWrite Lock pattern is a
specialized form of the Scheduler pattern.  For some applications,
e.g., the very "bid system" discussed in the textbook as a client
of this pattern, an alternative and simpler implementation is
viable.  Under the assumption that there are not waiting writers
all the time and the order of pending writes is irrelevant (as for
a "bid system"), no queue is needed.  Writers, similarly to
readers, are simply held until access is non-deterministically
granted.
<P>
Design, code and test this alternative implementation of the
ReadWrite Lock pattern.
