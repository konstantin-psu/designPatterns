<H2>Scheduler</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Consider the simulation of a robot that delivers parcels of mail
between desks on a same floor. Each request comes at a random
time.  Parameters such that the origin and destination desks are
ignored for the purpose of this exercise.  Each request has
priority and the amount of time or duration necessary for the
delivery.  The priority is 0 (bulk), 1 (regular), or 2 (express).
The robot should deliver parcels in the order in which they arrive
except for the priority.  If the delivery of a parcel has not
begun and the delivery of a new parcel with higher priority is
requested, the new parcel will be delivered first.
<P>
Design, code, and test a simulation of the robot activities.
Assume that delivery requests and delivery time are uniformly and
randomly distributed.  Use a Scheduler pattern to schedule
concurrent requests to the robot.

<LI>
   A difficulty of this exercise is to simulate the clients.
   Consider constructing a dozen or two threads that wake up at
   random times and request a delivery with a random priority and
   duration.  Some (but not too many) requests should be overlapping.
<LI>
   The scheduler pattern is quite difficult.  You may simplify the
   technique described in the textbook by hardcoding in the scheduler
   the scheduling order (this solution is less general, but it may
   ease understanding a difficult pattern).
<LI>
   Ideally you first code a solution that does not use a scheduler.
   The robot simply delivers parcels in the order in which they are
   requested, i.e., it ignores the priority.  Then you add the scheduler.
<LI>
   The scheduler uses wait() and notify() to first prevent and
   then free the access to a resource.  Could these be replaced by
   suspend() and resume()?
