<H2>Single Threaded Execution (6.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Define a simple class, say Position, that holds three numbers,
e.g., representing the cooordinates of an airplane in the sky.
Define a method to set a position and methods to get its
coordinates.  Set up two threads, say Reader and Writer, that
respectively get (read) and set (write) a position.
<P>
Since the threads may read and write a position concurrently,
without some care, it may be possible to get positions that were
never set.  To verify this possibility, design the writer
thread so that the three coordinates of a position are the same.
In the reader thread, if after reading a position the coordinates
are not the same, issue a message.
<P>
You can fix the problem, by synchronizing read and write accesses
to a position.  An object with synchronized read/write access is
called a Protected Variable.
