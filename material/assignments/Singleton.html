<H2>Singleton(2.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Design, code and test a class, caller a logger, to log messages to
a file.  Only one instance of this class should exist in an entire
program.  The key method of the class, <TT>log</TT>, takes a string and
appends it to a file.  This method is called from various locations
of an application to record "interesting events" of the execution.
<P>
Parameterize the logger with the name of
the log file and an integer verbosity level (the higher the level
the more verbose the log).  These parameters do
not change during the lifetime of the logger.
<P>
Code a driver program to test the
logger.  Obviously, you will use the Singleton pattern for your
implementation.  Would there be any advantage or disadvantage in
advoiding the creation of an object and using only static methods?
