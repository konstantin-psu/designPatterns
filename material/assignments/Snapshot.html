<H2>Snapshot (5.5.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Extend the program of the example 5.4 with a Snapshot pattern
mechanism.  The object to be preserved is (a state of) the Board.
It is desirable not to violate the information hidden by the Board.
<P>
For the purpose of this exercise, add two buttons to the
interface: one to make the snapshot and the other to restore the
board from the snapshot.  Keep the snapshot of the board
in memory.  
<P>
Some authors call the Snapshot pattern Memento.

<H2>Snapshot (5.5.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Modify the program of example 5.5.1 to save a snapshot on disk.
Place a timestamp in the snapshot so that when a state of the game
of Othello is restored the program reports the timestamp of the
snapshot.
