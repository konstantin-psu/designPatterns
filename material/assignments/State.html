<H2>State (5.7)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Envision a multilevel computer game that simulates driving a car.
In the initial level, the road's condition is "regular".  As the
player moves to higher levels, new conditions of the road appear,
e.g., gravel, wet, ice.  The response to the car's controls,
steering, braking, etc., varies with the road conditions.  The game
employs a State pattern to react to the player's use of the car controls.
<P>
For the purpose of this exercise, design a small GUI with four
buttons (labeled left, accel, right and brake), a choice of
conditions (labeled regular, gravel, wet and ice), and a feedback
textfield showing the effect (in an arbitrary scale) of pressing a
button in a given road ondition as follows:
<PRE>
               Regular   Gravel    Wet     Ice
        left      5        3        4       1
       accel      9        7        9       3
       right      5        3        4       1
       brake      8        6        7       2
</PRE>
Hint: One does not need to use the State pattern to manage such a
trivial state.  Pretend that the behavior of the car in various
conditions is determinted by the simulator using complicated
independent algorithms that are better encapsulated in various
states.
