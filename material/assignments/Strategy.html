<BLOCKQUOTE>

Code a few algorithms for sorting an array of Comparable objects,
e.g., straight selection sort, quicksort, and a combination of these
where quicksort is used for long arrays and selection for short ones.
<P>
Test the performance of your algorithms with a driver that
constructs a random array and times the execution of each
algorithm on the array.
