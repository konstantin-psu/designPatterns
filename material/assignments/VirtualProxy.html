<H2>VirtualProxy (4.7.1)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The previous example, Problem 4.6 - 
<A HREF="DynamicLinkage.html">Dynamic Linkage</A>, is also an
example of Virtual Proxy.  Class "GourmetPizzaFactory" is not
implemented.  Executing the client with command line argument "2"
generates exception "NoClassDefFoundError".  However, for different
values of the argument this class is not loaded and the execution of
the client does not generates this exception.

<H2>VirtualProxy (4.7.2)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Dynamic linkage is not necessary for dynamic loading.
Design and execute a small experiment to verify that a
class is loaded only when needed.  For instance, the need
to load a class arises when the class's constructor is executed.
Hint: Designate a class as "expensive to instantiate".
Code a program that waits for user input.
When the user provides this input, a method of the proxy
executes the constructor of the expensive-to-instantiate
class.  Remove this class from the file system and execute
the program.
