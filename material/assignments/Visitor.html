<H2>Visitor (5.11)</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The Visitor pattern is one of the most important --- and most
difficult patterns to understand and use.  Your instructor has
modified exercise 5.3.1
(<A HREF="LittleLanguage.html">Little Language</A>)
to use a visitor.  The visitor provided by
the instructor implements the printing of the statements.
<P>
You are required to modify the instructor's code in two ways.
First, design, code and test a new visitor for interpreting
"while" programs.  Note that the "expr" package remains unchanged.
Then, modify the "expr" package to use a visitor and design, code
and test a visitor to evaluate expressions of "while" programs.
