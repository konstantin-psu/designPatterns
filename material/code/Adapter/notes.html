<H4>The problem</H4>

A matrix manipulation package provides operations such as addition
and subtraction of matrices.  These operations are static which
introduce an interesting twist to the problem.  For example, one
cannot introduce an interface or abstract class to define
matrices.  Interfaces and abstract classes cannot define static
methods.  The class is like:

<PRE>
  public class Matrix {
      protected Matrix (Matrix m) {...}          // shallow copy
      public Matrix (double [] [] entry) {...}
      public static Matrix plus (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
      public static Matrix minus (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
  }
</PRE>

A client expects operations with a different identifier (name), e.g.,
<EM>add</EM> instead of <EM>plus</EM>.

<PRE>
      public static Matrix add (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
      public static Matrix sub (Matrix l, Matrix r) {...}
</PRE>

<H4>The twist</H4>

The matrix manipulation package is given and it should not be modified.
The client should be modified as little as possible.
Observe that the matrix operations are static.
This makes sense.  Adding two matrices together should not modify
either addend.

<H4>The solution</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
The adapter extends class Matrix, so any Matrix operation that does
not require adaptation can be accessed directly.
This is not typical of an adapter.
<LI>
The adapter is in a new package.
This allows to preserve the identifier <EM>Matrix</EM> in the client,
though the referenced class may change by changing the imported
package(s).
<LI>
The solution requires converting instances of the old (original)
class Matrix to the new class Matrix.
This is easily and efficiently provided by a shallow copy constructor.
The adaptation proper looks like:
<PRE>
    public static Matrix add (Matrix l, Matrix r) {
	return new Matrix (Matrix.plus (l, r));
    }
</PRE>
</UL>

<H4>Related patterns</H4>

  - Delegation: when not to use inheritance<BR>
  - Proxy: hide one object from another<BR>
  - Adapter: keep one class independent of another<BR>
  - Facade: single interface to several classes<BR>
