In the proposed solution, the stack functionality is severely
deficient, e.g., there is not even a top method and to show the
content of a stack it is necessary do destroy the stack itself.

However, this limitation makes the stack much easier to understand
and allows the student to focus on the Bridge pattern rather than
on the stack.
