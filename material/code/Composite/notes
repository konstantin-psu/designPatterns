Syntax

  Statement   ::= Assignment | Conditional | While | Compound
  Assignment  ::= Var = Expr
  Conditional ::= if Expr then Statement else Statement
  While       ::= while Expr do Statement
  Compound    ::= begin Statement; ...; Statement end

Example program

  begin
    fact = 1;
    while (n > 1) do
      begin
        fact := fact * n;
        n := n - 1
      end
  end

Corresponding Java object (Expression are still undefined)

  Statement factorial = new Compound (
    new Assignment ("fact", new Expr ()),
    new While (new Expr (), new Compound (
      new Assignment ("fact", new Expr ()),
      new Assignment ("n", new Expr ()))));
 
==================================================================

Typical operations (child management) of a composite object
missing from this example:
  - add: an abstract component
  - remove: an abstract component
  - getComponent: an index


==================================================================

Issues:
  - explicit reference to parent
  - sharing components
  - maximizing component interface
  - list of children in interface
  - child management operations
  - child ordering
  - data structure
