Define classes to represent and evaluate simple integer
expressions such as, e.g., "3+2-1".  Then, consider the problem of
measuring the time it takes to evaluate an expression, e.g., for
profiling or billing purposes. One obvious possibility is to
extend (subclass) some classes used to represent expressions with
the new functionality.  Another option is to decorate (i.e., use
the Decorator pattern) existing classes.

Choosing decoration requires a bit more design, but a bit less
code and offers more flexibility.  Concerning design, one needs an
interface defining the classes that may be decorated.  Concerning
code, one can have a single decorator rather than many subclasses.
Note that the interface required by the decorator would in many
cases be already in place.

The decorator of this example works well because the decorator's
functionality is fairly well separated from the functionality of
the decorated classes.  For example, if the problem was to count
the number of elementary operations (such as additions) performed
for an evaluation, a decorator would not be that useful.
