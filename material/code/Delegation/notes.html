<h3>Notes</h3>

The problem calls for 2 main concepts: a <em>Person</em> and
a set of <em>Roles</em> played by the <em>Person</em>.
<P>
A <em>Person</em> keeps a set of <em>Roles</em> which
changes dynamically.  When something depending on the roles
is asked to a person, the person delegates to all its roles
the computation and returns either one of the answers or a combination
of all the answers.  The details are problem specific.
