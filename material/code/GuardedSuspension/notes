Consider a simulator of a machine that fills boxes of breakfast
cereals.  The filling is simulated by repeatedly calling a method
that drops a certain amount of cerals into the box during a
certain interval of time.  Both the amount of cereals and the
interval of time for a drop are subject to small random
variations.  As a safety measure, the machine has a shutoff device
that shuts off itself if the content of the box exceeds a certain
threshold.

Design, code an implement the simulator.  Use a thread to
repeatedly call the drop method.  Use a guarded suspension pattern
for the shutoff device.  Hint: to test the safety device,
your drop method may systematically return true.

On the instructor system using Sun's JSDK1.2.2 for linux, the
solution compiles without errors, but the execution produces

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: (class: Main$Watcher, method: run signature: ()V) Incompatible type for getting or setting field
	at Main.<init>(Main.java:30)
	at Main.main(Main.java:101)

Using IBM's JDK 2 version 1.3.0 for linux the program compiles and
executes as expected.
