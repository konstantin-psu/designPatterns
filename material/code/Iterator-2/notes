The code in this directory is a thread-based implementation of the
iterator exercise.

The Main program and the tree package of this implementation
are unchanged with respect to the the stack implementation.

The inorder iterator uses a thread that allows "switching
context" as coroutines do.  Students should consider this implementation
only after the presentation in class of the Concurrency patterns.
