<h3>
Notes</h3>
This example assumes a rudimentary knowledge of the Java approach to <i>RMI</i>
(remote method invocation).&nbsp; Students without any knowledge of <i>RMI</i>
may prefer to study the proposed solution and perhaps extend it with a
new operation, e.g., subtraction or multiplication. The steps required
for executing the remote calculator are contained in the <i>Perl</i> script
<tt><a href="cmd.pl">cmd.pl</a></tt>
in this directory. The security setting for executing the remote calculator
are defined in file <tt><a href="java.policy">java.policy</a></tt> in this
directory.
<p>The proposed interface <i>CalculatorIF</i> implements/extends <i>Remote</i>,
an empty interface or marker, defined in the <b><tt>java.rmi</tt></b> package.&nbsp;
Why is this&nbsp; marker needed?&nbsp; If <i>CalculatorIF</i> does not
implement/extend <i>Remote</i>, then, when the "<b><tt>rmic</tt></b>"
utility is executed on <i>Calculator</i>, the class that implements interface
<i>CalculatorIF</i>, the following error is reported:
<blockquote><tt>error: Stubs are only needed for classes that directly
implement an interface that extends java.rmi.Remote; class Calculator does
not directly implement a remote interface.</tt></blockquote>
