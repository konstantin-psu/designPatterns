Consider a board for the game of Othello.  The problem of deciding
whether a player can occupy a position on the board can be
delegated to the position itself or to an object that implements a
Mediator pattern.  The mediator encapsulates how the positions
interact in a move of the game.  Hence it should implement the
move as well.

Design, code and test such an object.  In addition, discuss the
design of a program that does not use a mediator, but lets the
positions interact with each other.

THE PROPOSED SOLUTION

The class "Mediator" serves two purposes: (1) a mediator of the
positions and (2) a mouse listener of the positions.  For purpose
#2, it is convenient to have an object for each position.  Each
object has the position it is listening to "hard wired" at
construction.  For purpose #1, each mediator works exactly as any
other, the only difference being the row and column of the
position that has been clicked.

A solution more conformant to the pattern would place position
listeners and mediator proper in different classes.  A listener
would activate the mediator when a position is clicked and pass
the clicked position to it at that time.
