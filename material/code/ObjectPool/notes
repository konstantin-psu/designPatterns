Design note

Method reset in class Cons should not be public,
since it give full write access to internal private variables.
However it is necessary by the pool to manage list nodes.
For this reason, it is package visible and the pool management
class is in the list package as well.

An alternative option would be to make the pool an inner class of
Cons and use a factory to aquire, or construct, and release Cons
objects.
