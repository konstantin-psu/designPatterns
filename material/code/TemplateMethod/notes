Intent [liberally from GoF 325]

Define the skeleton of an algorithm deferring some steps to
subclasses.  Subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm
without changing the algorithm's structure.

Related patterns

- Factory Methods are often called by Template Methods
- Template Methods use inheritance to vary parts of an algorithm
- Strategies use delegation to vary the entire algorithm
