Dynamic linkage is not necessary for dynamic loading. Design and
execute a small experiment to verify that a class is loaded only
when needed. For instance, the need to load a class arises when
the class's constructor is executed. 

Hint: Designate a class as "expensive to instantiate". Code a
program that waits for user input. When the user provides this
input, a method of the proxy executes the constructor of the
expensive-to-instantiate class. Remove this class from the file
system and execute the program.
