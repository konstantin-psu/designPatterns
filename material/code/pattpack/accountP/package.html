This package has been coded to show the use of the prototype
patter.
It is very similar to package {@link #top "../account/index.html"}
except for the necessity of cloning some classes.
<P>
The package <EM>minimally</EM> abstracts a computer account
and a security manager that checks that the limits imposed
on the account are respected.
