<TD>Origin:</TD>
<TD>GoF 95</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Reason:</TD>
<TD>
    To issue a command to an object that may execute it or
    send it to another object for execution.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Synopsis:</TD>
<TD>
    Different commands are executed by different objects in a chain.
    Objects early in the chain pass on commands they should not execute.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Example:</TD>
<TD>
    Consider a security system.
    In a system with only a few sensors, an alarm is handled locally,
    e.g., ring a bell.  In a large system, an alarm is reported
    to a remote control station.

  <TD><B>CommandSender</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Calls <EM>postCommand</EM> of the first object in the chain.
      It is the client of the chain.
  </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>CommandHandler</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Superclass of all the <EM>ConcreteCommandHandlers</EM>
      in a chain of responsibility.
      Defines methods <EM>postCommand</EM>
      that manages the chaining of commands, and
      <EM>handleCommand</EM> that returns whether
      a command was completely executed.
      Has link to next <EM>CommandHandler</EM> in the chain.
  </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>ConcreteCommandHandler<SUB>i</SUB></B></TD>
  <TD>
      These classes override <EM>handleCommand</EM>, but not
