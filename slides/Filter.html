<TD>Reason:</TD>
<TD>
    Perform composable transformations and computations on streams.
</TD>

<TD>Synopsis:</TD>
<TD>
    Define a <EM>composable</EM>
    interface common to all transformations and computations.
    Make implementations of the interface independent of their contexts.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Example:</TD>
<TD>
    A class that counts the number of bytes and/or lines of a stream.

  <TD><B>SourceFilter</B></TD>
  <TD>
      There is both an interface and one or more concrete classes

  <TD><B>SinkFilter</B></TD>
  <TD>
      There is both an interface and one or more concrete classes

  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>Sink</B></TD>
  <TD>
      There is both an interface and one or more concrete classes
      that abstract a stream that consumes data.
