<TD>Origin:</TD>
<TD>GoF 95</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Reason:</TD>
<TD>
    To establish dependencies between objects so that when one
    object changes state, its dependent objects are informed.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Synopsis:</TD>
<TD>
    Define and implement interfaces with methods to register dependencies
    between objects and to notify dependent objects of state changes.
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Example:</TD>
<TD>
    In a security system objects that trigger alarms 
    must notify objects that handle alarms, but at the same
    time they must be largely independent of each other.

  <TD>
      There are both an interface and one or more implementing classes.
      The interface has an <EM>update</EM> method called by
      <EM>Observable</EM> objects when their state changes.

  <TR>
  <TD><B>Observable</B></TD>
  <TD>
      There are both an interface and one or more implementing classes.
      The interface has methods to <EM>add</EM> and <EM>remove</EM>
      <EM>Observer</EM> objects whose <EM>update</EM> method is called
      upon a state change.
