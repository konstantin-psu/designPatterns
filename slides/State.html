  <TD><B>Context</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Class whose instances exhibit stateful behavior.
      It keeps a reference to a <EM>ConcreteState</EM> object
      that implements the state functionality.
      It is the client of the State pattern.
  </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>ContextState</B></TD>
  <TD>

  <TR>
  <TD><B>ConcreteState<SUB>i</SUB></B></TD>
