<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>
<TD>Origin:</TD>
<TD>Larman 98</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Reason:</TD>
<TD>
    Delay the instantiation of an object (expensive to instantiated)
    until the object is needed.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Synopsis:</TD>
<TD>
    Create an object, the <EM>VirtualProxy</EM>, that allows
    clients indirect access to the expensive-to-create object,
    and hides from clients whether the expensive-to-create object
    exists.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Example:</TD>
<TD>
    A large applet executes several well-separated components.
    A typical execution of the applet requires some, but not
    all, these components.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Solution:</TD>
<TD>
  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=100%>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>Client</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Class that needs the services of the <EM>Service</EM> class.
      The <EM>Client</EM> does not access the <EM>Service</EM> class
      directly, thus it is insensitive to whether the
      <EM>Service</EM> class is loaded.
  </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>Service</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Class providing services to the <EM>Client</EM>.
      Supposedly, the <EM>Service</EM> class is expensive to
      load and/or instantiate.
  </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>ServiceIF</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Interface implemented by both the <EM>Service</EM> and the
      <EM>ServiceProxy</EM> classes.
  </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
  <TD><B>ServiceProxy</B></TD>
  <TD>
      Class that provides services to the <EM>Client</EM>
      through the <EM>Service</EM> class.  It loads and/or
      instantiates this class only when needed.
