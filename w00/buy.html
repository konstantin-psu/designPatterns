From time to time, students seek my advice to select which courses to take.
My initial advice is always to get all the available information about each
course that they are considering.
In this spirit, I provide the following information about
CS510DP, Design Patterns (in Java), offered in the Winter 2000 term.
This material, in addition to the current syllabus available
from my homepage, is intended to enable prospective students to make an
informed decision before enrolling into new offerings of this course.

The syllabus was made available several months before the
beginning of the course.  The syllabus links handouts, assignments
with complete solutions, and relevant references.
The document linked here is the most
recent version for the Winter 2000 term.

  Feedback</A>
</TD>
<TD>
The linked document, and subdocuments, contain the answers
to a questionnaire filled by the students at the end of the course. 
The questionnaire was prepared by the instructor.
A similar, less detailed, questionnaire is required by the department,
but it is not made public.  Filling the questionnaire was
voluntary.  Not all the students answered all the questions.
The answers were provided by the students anonymously.
The answers in the linked document have been copied verbatim
by the instructor from the student forms.
In a few places, averages have been added.
