<LI>
Yes.
<LI>
Yes, I found the material very interesting and the way it
was presented made it clear.
<LI>
It's a useful course. I learned a lot out of patterns!
<LI>
Yes. The concepts learned can be applied to any programming situation.
<LI>
Yes, but only if that person already knows some OOP.
<LI>
Yes!! I feel this is the future of software development.
<LI>
Yes, if that student has command over Java.

Yes. It gave a good introduction to the patterns concepts and
illustrated additional issues in Java programming.
<LI>
Yes, because I think the course covers useful topics and is taught well.

Sure.  My answer is the same as above.
Attending this course will give the student a chance to
appreciate good object oriented design patterns.

through it saves time to digest the material.
It has got many real world applications.

Yes, expecially as a quick way to come up to speed
programming in the Java language after an introductory course.
<LI>
Yes.
<LI>
Yes. Java is my first OOP language I learned.
The variety of examples and codes exposes the tricks of
language to those who are new to OOP clearly and easily.
