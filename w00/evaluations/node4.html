<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Very good time slot for me.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Probably 5:00pm-6:30 is better.</TD>
</TR>

</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, would be very useful.</TD>

<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Absolutely yes.</TD>
</TR>

<TD ALIGN="LEFT">O.K.</TD>

<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">[no answer]</TD>

</TABLE>
<P>
<LI> Were classroom and audiovisual equipment adequate?
    <TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">22</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes. Some pages on screen where difficult to read.</TD>
</TR>

<LI> Were computing accounts and services satisfactory?
    <TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">23</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

<P>
<LI> Was the reading material adequate for the course?
    <TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">17</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">2</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">OK.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Maybe not, had difficulty in learning Java.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Though textbook could be better. For some of the patterns
            I use the GoF book.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">The textbook was pretty bad, but other materials were good.
            The web material needs links between cards, assignment +
            solution of each pattern.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Probably could have used the Gamma et.al book on patterns
            in addition to required text.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<LI> Was the course well organized?
    <TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">16</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, but needs improvement.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">No. You should consider changing the order of the patterns
            (maybe do the big 4 creational patterns later, etc.).</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes. I would like to see them presented on a project
            by project basis. To see pattern relationships.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes; but a mid-term exam will really help
            than just having a final exam.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Hmm - maybe lesser patterns would have made a big difference.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, can improve by reaching advanced features of Java
            like JDBC, RMI, etc.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">1</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Not in terms of homework.
            There was too much homework to do, for many weeks.
            The matter covered in class was simple so the class
            context was moving fast.
            Corresponding assignment were too much.
            The result was that homework had to be done in a hurry,
            thereby at the cost of learning.
            On the other hand, if you spent time learning, you
            couldn't do the homework to your satifsfaction.
            A ``happy medium'' needs to be reached.</TD>
