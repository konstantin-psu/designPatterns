Overall</A>
</H3>
<UL>
<LI> What is the best feature of this course?
    <UL>
<LI>
    Instructor.
<LI>
    All the patterns we learned about.
<LI>
    Useful.
<LI>
    The knowledge gained is very useful.
<LI>
    Homework.
<LI>
    Question &amp; Answers and HW.
<LI>
    Learning Pattens.
<LI>
    Learning the new patterns concepts, they were distilled into slides very well.
<LI>
    Subject matter, plus in Java.
    Also liked: Quick assignment feedback; On-line solutions
    when we got stuck, or just to see how you did it.
<LI>
    Lots of code.
<LI>
    The course has too many patterns &amp; too many assignments.
    I expect the Prof. to teach only important patterns &amp;
    then devote half the time on teaching Java in class which
    will use for the assignments.  E.g., some of the homework
    were done in Swing, so I expect Prof to cover that part
    in class. In short, it would be a great course if Prof. mixes
    this ``DPJ'' with his previous ``Advanced Course in Java''.
<LI>
    Practical application of the course.
<LI>
    Right mix of theory and practice.
<LI>
    Assignments.
<LI>
    All in all a great course!
<LI>
    Interaction in class.
<LI>
    Context.
<LI>
    A new subject.
<LI>
    Solid OO Design concepts.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI> What is the worst feature of this course?
    <UL>
<LI>
    Textbook.
<LI>
    I thought that the textbook was very often difficult to understand.
<LI>
    Textbook.
<LI>
    Text.
<LI>
    Too much homework.
<LI>
    Too much non patterns related Java coding.
<LI>
    Number of assignments and the workload.
<LI>
    Some weeks prog. assign. got up to 7.
<LI>
    Offered off campus.
<LI>
    Too many patterns to digest.
<LI>
    Homework.
<LI>
    Homework requires too much time in some cases.
<LI>
    Again homework!  Note: Inspite of my repeated mention of homework as a
    problem, the matter was very good. I enjoyed this course fully.
    and not regret taking it at all! Good luck with future offerings
    of this course.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI> What would you change about this course?
    <UL>
<LI>
    Change order of patterns, add inter-section links for patterns.
<LI>
    Move it downtown.
<LI>
    Downtown.
<LI>
    Project based set-of-patterns.
<LI>
    Make less number of assignment.
<LI>
    I'd make the homeworks more related to each other.
    I'd eliminate all GUI coding.
<LI>
    Another textbook?
<LI>
    Start offering on campus.
<LI>
    Location.
<LI>
    Decrease number of patterns.
<LI>
    Clarify problem statement for some assignments.
<LI>
    Better text.
<LI>
    Teach less patterns or balance homework better.
<LI>
    Timing.
<LI>
    Predictably, being about more of a balance
    between class work &amp; home work.
    </UL>
<P>
<LI> What would you add to this course?
    <UL>
<LI>
    More discussion on patterns in Java built-in utilities.
<LI>
    UML introduction and usage in each pattern.
<LI>
    More examples on each pattern.
<LI>
    I'd provide the ``grunt'' Java code, such as the low and high
    quality stacks, then let the students code the specific pattern
    that use them, rather than having to provide whole solutions.
<LI>
    1 Lecture on UML. More classroom explanations using diagram
    and UML.
<LI>
    More focus on java.net + java.beans.
<LI>
    Teach advanced features of Java.
<LI>
    Better text.
<LI>
    Covering textbook examples in some cases.
<LI>
    A project.
<LI>
    Nothing.    
    </UL>
<P>
<LI> What would you remove from this course?
    <UL>
<LI>
    A better text.
<LI>
    Study less number of patterns.
<LI>
    I'd eliminate GUI-related code or provide it as part of the
    exercise. I have taken the Java course over a year ago and
    forgot much of the GUI related API. At times it was difficult
    to see the ``forest for the trees'' meaning I was coding the
    solution too much and not focusing on the pattern I was
    implementing.
<LI>
    Some of the trivial patterns, e.g., some of the earlier
    patterns covered during the first half of the course.
<LI>
    Keep it the same.
<LI>
    It will be good as it is.
