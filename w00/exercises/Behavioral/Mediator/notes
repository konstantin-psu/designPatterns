Consider a board for the game of Othello.  The problem of deciding
whether a player can occupy a position on the board can be
delegated to the position itself or to an object that implements a
Mediator pattern.  The mediator encapsulates how the positions
interact in a move of the game.  Hence it should implement the
move as well.

Design, code and test such an object.  In addition, discuss the
design of a program that does not use a mediator, but lets the
positions interact with each other.
