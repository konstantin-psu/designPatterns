Extend the program of the Mediator example with a Snapshot pattern
mechanism.  The object to be preserved is (a state of) the Board.
It is important not to violate the information hidden by the Board.

For the purpose of this exercise, add two buttons to the
interface: one to make the snapshot and the other to restore the
board from the snapshot.  Consider two separate implementations:
one where the snapshot is held in memory, another where the
snapshot is stored on disk.

The Snapshot pattern is also called Memento.
