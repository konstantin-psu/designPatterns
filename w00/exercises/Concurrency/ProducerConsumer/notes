In a computer game, coconuts fall from a tree.  Three monkeys on
the ground must catch the coconuts before they hit the ground and
eat them.  Suppose that a new coconut falls between 0 and 250
milliseconds with uniform distribution.  The monkey that catches
the coconut is busy for 500 milliseconds to eat it before it can
catch another one.  The game ends when a coconut hits the ground.

Model the game using a Producer-Consumer pattern.  Your program
should produce a trace showing the events of a game.  Run your
program a few times to count how many coconuts fall from the tree
before the game ends (usually between 10 and 19 on the
instructor's system).
