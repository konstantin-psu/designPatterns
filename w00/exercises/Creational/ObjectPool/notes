Design note

Method reset in class Cons does not seem a good idea
since it give full write access to internal private variables.
However it is necessary by the pool to manage list nodes.

It would be better to put the pool class in the list package
and to allow the pool to access the members of Cons objects
by giving them default (package) visibility.

Alternately, consider making the pool an inner class of Cons
and use a factory to aquire and release Cons objects.
