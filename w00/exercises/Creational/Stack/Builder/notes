Intent:
  Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
  so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Participants:
  - Builder
  - ConcreteBuilder
  - Director
  - Product

Code:
  The Director is the main program.  It creates a stack.  The stack
  is unbound when the command line has no arguments.  Otherwise, the
  stack has bounded size and the size is specified by the first
  argument of the command line.  No other argument is used.

  The Director executes push, pop, and top operations of the stack.
  During execution, the stack reaches the maximum size of 31 elements.
  When the Director selects a bounded stack whose size is less than
  31, an exception is thrown and the program terminates.

  A builder generally builds several components of a complex object.
  In this example, for simplicity, only a single object, a stack,
  is generated.
