Interface CalculatorIF extends interface Remote because interface
Remote serves to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked
from a non-local virtual machine.  Without extending Remote, rmic
complains that Stubs are only needed for classes that directly
implement an interface that extends Remote.

The constructor of class Calculator must be defined explicitly in
order to throw RemoteException.  This is necessary because the
constructor of its superclass, UnicastRemoteObject, throws it.

Implementations of method add in Client and Proxy are public
because the access modifier cannot be made more restrictive.
All members of interfaces are implicitly public (§6.6.1.).

Methods of interface CalculatorIF must throw RemoteException.  If
they don't, rmic complains that CalculatorIF is not a valid remote
interface when it tries to create Stub and Skel.

Methods of class Proxy do not throw RemoteException, contrary to
methods of class Calculator, although they implement methods of
interface CalculatorIF that throw RemoteException.  This is
accepted by the language (§8.4.4).
