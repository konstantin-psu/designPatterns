Problem: Need multiple implementations of an abstraction
Solution: Define a class to encapsulate common logic.
          and subclasses to encapsulate specialized logic.
Drawback: does not work when common logic is used to decide
          which specialized class to instantiate.
Fix: encapsulate the common and specialized logic
     to create an object in unrelated classes.

Problem: multiple implementations of an image class
         for a gif, pbm, pnf, etc. file.  Pass filename
         to constructor.  Must decide class before looking
         at constructor argument.         
Solution: Uses an internal "image reader" specialized by
          the image type or format: gif, pbm, pnf, etc.
          The image reader (extra layer) is constructed
          by a creational pattern.
