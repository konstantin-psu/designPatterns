<P>
This is an individual, closed-book exam.
There are 6 problems.
You have 75 minutes to complete this exam.

<P>
If a problem asks for an example or a fragment of code,
please, answer with the simplest example or fragment of code
you can think of.

<P>
If a problem asks for a Yes/No or similar answer, please
make sure that your solution provides this answer.

<P>
If you feel that you need to make additional assumptions
for the solution of a problem, please state the assumptions
you make.

<!--
<P>
<B>Return this exam stapled to your answers.</B>
You are encouraged to write your answers on this exam
whenever possible.  You can use additional sheets
if you need to write more.

<DT>1.
<DD>
What is the name of the pattern intended
to prevent concurrent access to data?

<P>

Sketch the code/structure of this pattern.

<P>
<BR>

<DT>2.
<DD>
The <EM>Singleton Pattern</EM> relies on two key Java constructs
or features to ensure that:
(1) at most only one object of a class is ever created by clients, and
(2) a reference to the unique instance of the singleton class is always accessible to clients.

<P>
Name and briefly explain these features.

<P>
Sketch the code/structure of this pattern.

<P>
<BR>

<DT>3.
<DD>
A command of a <EM>Command Pattern</EM>, say <EM>SetCurrentClock</EM>,
is intended to set the current time within an application program.

<P>
Discuss the key elements of a class that implements
the <EM>SetCurrentClock</EM> command and sketch its code.
Hint: you can assume the existence of any time manipulation
method that you need.  Use an expressive enough name for any
such method and/or describe with a comment or separately what the method does.

<P>

Sketch the code/structure of the <EM>SetCurrentClock</EM> class.

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<DT>4.
<DD>
The <EM>Factory Method Pattern</EM> is used to construct
families of related objects.  This pattern relies on a key
property of Object Oriented Programming Languages and
Java in particular.

<P>
Describe this property and how it enables the pattern
to construct different objects.  Hint: In your answer,
I am looking for a clear, complete and concise explanation.
I do not want to read code.

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<DT>5.
<DD>
The <EM>Visitor Pattern</EM> relies on both <EM>overloading</EM>
and <EM>overriding</EM> of methods.  Briefly define these concepts and use
a minimal abstract example to clarify your statements or definitions.
I am not asking for a description or an example of an actual visitor.

<P>
What are the conventional names and signatures of the overloaded
and overridden methods in the <EM>Visitor Pattern</EM>.

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<DT>6.
<DD>
For each question check zero or more choices according to the directions.

<DD>Tests whether two references refer to objects with the same value.
</DL>
<P>
<DT>(c)
<DD>
<EM>Enumeration</EM> in package <EM>java.util</EM> identifies
(check all the correct choices):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>

<DT><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>
<DD>An abstract class.

<DT><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>
<DD>None of the above choices.
</DL>
<P>
<DT>(d)
<DD>
The <EM>Prototype Pattern</EM> creates new objects by

<DD>Shallow copying.
<DT><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>

<DD>An appropriate combination of both the above choices.
<DT><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>
<DD>Invoking either method <EM>clone</EM> or a ``copy constructor.''
</DL>
<P>
<DT>(e)
<DD>
The ``extrinsic state'' of a <EM>Flyweight</EM> object is
(check all the correct choices):
<DL COMPACT>
