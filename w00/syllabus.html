<strong><A NAME="Description"></A>Description</strong>
<UL>
  This course provides an in-depth view of Software Design Patterns.
  The programming language used for presentation and analysis is
  Java.  The course is suitable to software architects and developers
  who are already well-versed in this language.
  Patterns are reusable solutions to recurring software problems.
  They capture successful experiences and
  convey expert insight and knowledge to less experienced developers.
  In addition,
  this course will offer continuous opportunities for learning the
  most advanced features of the Java language and understanding
  the principles behind the design of its fundamental libraries.
</UL>

<strong><A NAME="Goal"></A>Goal</strong>
<UL>
At the end of this course, students are expected to: master the
Java language to the degree required by the subject; become
familiar with the situations and motivations that call for using
patterns; and be able to employ patterns in their appropriate
contexts.
</UL>

<strong><A NAME="Prerequisites"></A>Prerequisites</strong>
<UL>
CS510 Programming in Java or permission of the instructor.
Both ability to recognize and appreciate an elegant solution to
a problem and willingness to "learn" (as opposed to "live") an
experience are highly desirable.

<strong><A NAME="Schedule"></A>Schedule</strong>
<UL>
The instructor will present the 41 patterns of the textbook
during the lectures.
The course is 10 weeks long.  
This entails an average of about four patterns per week,
although some patterns will take more time than others.
The patterns will be presented in the same order in which they
occur in the textbook.
<P>
The homework consists in one or more
<A HREF="../exercises/assignments.html">assignments</A>
per pattern.
The assignments for a pattern  are due one week
after the presentation of the pattern in class.
In the case of holidays and class cancellations,
the assignment is due the following lecture.
<P>
The final exam of OCATE-sponsored courses is held
at the same time and in the same classroom of the lectures.
The day is 10 weeks after the first day of class.
