 <H1>The Sequencing Problem</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<H2>A  problem occurs when people go through three or more checkpoints at about the same time. While the printer printings the first log entry, the other print call waits. After the first log entry is printed, there is no guarantee which log entry will be printed next. Log entries may not be printed in the same order they were sent to the printer.</H2>
