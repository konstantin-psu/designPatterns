<h1>A Simple Example of a SecurityManager</h1>
Here is a simple example of a <a href="shell/NoExitSecurityManager.java">
security manager</a>.
<br>It is intended for
use by a program that hosts other programs, such as a batch processing
shell.  The security policy that it implments is to prevent hosted
programms from sucessfully calling <code>System.exit</code>, while
still allowing the hosting program to do so.
<p>
The way that it distinguishes between methods in the hosting program
and hosted methods is that it expects the hosting program to invoke
the hosted program using a class called <a href="shell/Invoker.java">
<code>Invoker</code></a>.
<p>
I also have a simple example that uses these classes.  It consists of
an <a href="shell/NoExit.java">application that installs the security
manager</a> and then uses the <code>Invoker</code> class to invoke 
<a href="shell/Exit.java">a class that just calls 
<code>System.exit</code></a>
