<P>Internet e-mail allows mail messages to be exchanged between users of
computers around the world and occasionally beyond: to space shuttles.
One of the main reasons that Internet e-mail has achieved such wide use
is because it provides a standard mechanism for messages to be exchanged
between over 10,000,000 computers connected to the Internet.

<P>The standards that are the basis for Internet e-mail were established
in 1982. Though they were state of the art in 1982, in the intervening
years they have begun to show their age. The 1982 standards allow for mail
messages that contain a single human readable message with the restrictions
that:
<UL>
<LI>
the message contains only ASCII characters.</LI>

<LI>
the message contains no lines longer than 1000 characters.</LI>

<LI>
the message does not exceed a certain length</LI>
</UL>
The 1982 standards do not allow EDI to be reliably transmitted through
Internet e-mail, since EDI messages can violate all of these restrictions.
There are a number of other types of messages and services that have are
supported by other more recently designed e-mail standards. A new Internet
mail standard was approved in June of 1992. The new standard is called
MIME.

<P>MIME is an acronym for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It builds
on the older standard by standardizing additional fields for mail message
headers that describe new types of content and organization for messages.

<P>MIME allows mail messages to contain:
<UL>
<LI>
Multiple objects in a single message.</LI>

<LI>
Text having unlimited line length or overall length.</LI>

<LI>
Character sets other than ASCII, allowing non-English language messages.</LI>

<LI>
Multi-font messages.</LI>

<LI>
Binary or application specific files.</LI>

<LI>
Images, Audio, Video and multi-media messages.</LI>
</UL>
MIME defines the following new header fields:
<OL>
<LI>
The <TT>MIME-Version</TT> header field, which uses a version number to
declare that a message conforms to the MIME standard.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> header field, which can be used to specify the
type and subtype of data in the body of a message and to fully specify
the encoding of such data.</LI>

<OL continue type=a>
<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Text</TT>, which can be used to represent
textual information in a number of character sets and formatted text description
languages in a standardized manner.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Multipart</TT>, which can be used to
combine several body parts, possibly of differing types of data, into a
single message.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Application</TT>, which can be used
to transmit application data or binary data.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Message</TT>, for encapsulating a mail
message.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Image</TT>, for transmitting still
image (picture) data.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Audio</TT>, for transmitting audio
or voice data.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> value <TT>Video</TT>, for transmitting video
or moving image data, possibly with audio as part of the composite video
data format.</LI>
</OL>

<LI>
The <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT> header field, that specifies how
the data is encoded to allow it to pass through mail transports having
data or character set limitations.</LI>

<LI>
Two header fields that can be used to further identify and describe the
data in a message body: the <TT>Content-ID</TT> and <TT>Content-Description</TT>
header fields.</LI>
</OL>
MIME is an extensible mechanism. It is expected that the set of <TT>content-type/subtype</TT>
pairs and their associated parameters will grow with time. Several other
MIME fields, such as character set names, are likely to have new values
defined over time. To ensure that the set of such values develops in an
orderly, and public manner, MIME defines a registration process that uses
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for
such values.

<P>To promote interoperability between implementations, the MIME standard
document specifies a minimal subset of the above mechanisms that are required
for an implementation to claim to conform to the MIME standard.
<H3>
MIME Technical Summary</H3>
MIME is defined by an Internet standard document called <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">RFC</A><A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1521.txt">1521</A>.
This document summarizes the contents of <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">RFC1521</A>.
Sufficient detail is presented here to understand the capabilities of MIME.
For sufficient detail to implement MIME please read <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">RFC1521</A>.

<P>MIME allows messages to contain multiple objects. When multiple objects
are in a MIME message, they are represented in a form called a body part.
A body part has a header and a body, so it makes sense to speak about the
body of a body part. Also, body parts can be nested in bodies that contain
one or multiple body parts.

<P>The <TT>Content-Type</TT> values, subtypes, and parameter names defined
in the MIME standard are case-insensitive. However, many parameter values
are case sensitive

<P>The MIME standard is written to allow MIME to be extended in certain
ways, without having to revise the standard. MIME specifies sets of values
that are allowed for various fields and parameters. The provides a procedure
for extending these sets of values by registering them with an entity called
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
<H3>
The MIME-Version Header Field</H3>
MIME is designed to be compatible with older Internet mail standards. In
particular, it is compatible with <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>.
If a mail reading program receives a message that is a MIME message then
it will likely perform additional processing for the MIME message that
it would not perform for non-MIME messages. To allow mail reading programs
to recognize MIME messages, MIME messages are required to contain a MIME-Version
header field. The MIME-Version header field specifies the version of the
MIME standard that the message conforms to.

<P>As of this writing, there is only version (1.0) of the MIME standard.
Messages that comply with the standard must include a header field, with
the following verbatim text:

<P><TT>MIME-Version: 1.0</TT>

<P>The <TT>MIME-Version</TT> header field is required at the top level
of a message. It is not required for each body part of a multipart entity.
It is required for the embedded headers of a body of type Message if and
only if the embedded message is claimed to be MIME-compliant.
<H3>
The Content-Type Header Field</H3>
The <TT>Content-Type</TT> field describes the data contained in a body
fully enough that the mail reader can pick an appropriate mechanism to
present the data to the user, or otherwise deal with the data appropriately.

<P>The <TT>Content-Type</TT> header field is used to specify the nature
of data in the body or body part, by giving type and subtype identifiers,
and by providing parameters that may be needed for certain types. After
the type and subtype names, the remainder of the header field is a set
of parameters, specified in an attribute=value notation. The set of meaningful
parameters differs for different types. The order of parameters is not
significant. Comments are allowed (in accordance with <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
rules) in structured header fields by placing them in parentheses.

<P>The top-level <TT>Content-Type</TT> is used to declare the general type
of data, while the subtype specifies a specific format for that type of
data. Thus, a <TT>Content-Type</TT> of <TT>Image/xyz</TT> is enough to
tell a mail reader that the data is an image, even if the mail reader has
no knowledge of the specific image format xyz. Such information can be
used, to decide whether or not to show a user the raw data from an unrecognized
subtype: such an action might be reasonable for unrecognized subtypes of
<TT>Text</TT>, but not for unrecognized subtypes of <TT>Image</TT> or <TT>Audio</TT>.
For this reason, registered subtypes of <TT>Audio</TT>, <TT>Image</TT>,
<TT>Text</TT>, and <TT>Video</TT>, should not contain embedded information
that is really of a different type. Such compound types are usually represented
using the <TT>Multipart</TT> or <TT>Application</TT> types.

<P>Parameters are modifiers of the content-subtype. Although most parameters
make sense only with certain content-types, others are "global" in the
sense that they might apply to any subtype. For example, the <TT>Boundary</TT>
parameter, which is used to indicate how body parts are separated from
each other, makes sense only for the <TT>Multipart</TT> content-type. The
<TT>Charset</TT> parameter might make sense with several content-types.

<P>The MIME standard defines seven content-types. The authors of the MIME
standard state that the set of seven types is "substantially complete".
They expect additional supported types to be accommodated by creating new
subtypes of the seven initial top-level types. The MIME standard, functioning
as a constitution for the MIME community, states that new standard content
types can be defined only by revising the standard (as opposed to the registration
procedure for other types of extensions). However, MIME does provide for
the use of non-standard content types. Non-standard content-types can be
used, but must be given names starting with <TT>X-</TT>. Future standard
content type names will not begin with <TT>X-</TT>.

<P>The syntax for the content type header field is
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content-Type := type "/" subtype [";" parameter]_</PRE>
The defined content types are:
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Application</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates data that does not fit into any of the other categories, such
as uninterpreted binary data or information to be processed by a mail-based
application. In addition to the following subtypes, it is likely that additional
subtypes will be defined for applications such as mail-based scheduling
systems, spreadsheets and EDI.</DD>

<DL><TT>Application/Octet-Stream</TT>
<DD>
indicates uninterpreted binary data, which a mail reading program may simply
offer to write the information into a file. Possible parameters for <TT>Application/Octet-Stream</TT>
include:</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Name</TT></DT>

<DD>
a suggested name for the binary data if stored as a file.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>Type</TT></DT>

<DD>
the general type or category of binary data. This is intended for human
recipients rather than for automated processing.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>Padding</TT></DT>

<DD>
the number of bits of padding that were appended to the bit stream comprising
the actual contents to produce the enclosed byte-oriented data. This is
useful for enclosing a bit stream in a body when the total number of bits
is not a multiple of the byte size.</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Application/PostScript</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates a body containing a postscript document.</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Audio</TT></DT>

<DD>
Indicates audio data. Audio requires an audio output device (such as a
speaker or a telephone) to "display" the contents.</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Audio/Basic</TT></DT>

<DD>
The content of the Audio/Basic subtype is audio encoded using 8-bit ISDN
u-law. When this subtype is present, a sample rate of 8000 Hz and a single
channel is assumed.</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Image</TT></DT>

<DD>
Image data. Image requires a display device (such as a graphical display,
a printer, or a FAX machine) to view the information.</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Image/Jpeg</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates an image in JPEG format.</DD>

<DD>
&nbsp;</DD>

<DT>
<TT>Image/Gif</TT></DT>

<DT>
&nbsp;</DT>

<DD>
indicates an image in GIF format.</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Message</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates an encapsulated message.</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Message/RFC822</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates that the body contains an encapsulated message, with the syntax
of an <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
message. This is useful when forwarding a message or transmitting a digest
of messages, because it makes the beginning and end of such messages explicit.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>Message/Partial</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates a partial message, allowing fragmented transmission of bodies
too large to be passed through mail transport facilities. <TT>Message/Partial</TT>
indicates that the body contains a fragment of a larger message.</DD>


<P>Three parameters are required in a Content-Type field of type <TT>Message/Partial</TT>:
The first, <TT>Id</TT>, is a unique identifier, as close to world-unique
as possible, used to match the parts together. The second, <TT>Number</TT>,
an integer, is the part number indicating where this part fits into the
sequence of fragments. The third, <TT>Total</TT>, another integer, is the
total number of parts. <TT>Total</TT> is required on the final part, and
optional on earlier parts.
<DT>
<TT>Message/External-Body</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates that the actual body data are not included, but only referenced.
In this case, parameters describe a mechanism for accessing the external
data.</DD>


<P>When a body or body part is of type <TT>Message/External-Body</TT>,
it consists of a header, a blank line, and the message header for the encapsulated
message. If another blank line appears, this ends the message header for
the encapsulated message. However, since the encapsulated message's body
is itself external, it does not appear in the area that follows. For example,
consider this message:
<PRE>Content-type: message/external-body;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; access-type=local-file;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name="/u/nsb/Me.gif"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Content-type:&nbsp; image/gif
Content-ID:&nbsp;<id42@guppylake.bellcore.com>
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
THIS IS NOT REALLY THE BODY!</PRE>
The area at the end, which constitutes a phantom body, is ignored for most
external-body messages. However, it may be used to contain auxiliary information
for a "mail-server".

<P>The only parameter of <TT>Message/External-Body</TT> that is always
mandatory is <TT>AccessType</TT>. Its other parameters are mandatory or
optional depending on the value of Access-Type. The values defined for
the AccessType parameter are <TT>FTP</TT>, <TT>ANON-FTP</TT>, <TT>TFTP</TT>,
<TT>AFS</TT>, <TT>LOCAL-FILE</TT>, and <TT>MAIL-SERVER</TT>. Except for
values beginning with <TT>X-</TT>, all other values must be registered
with IANA.

<P>The standard specifies additional parameters for use in conjunction
with the various access types.

<P>In addition to access-type specific parameters, the standard defines
the following parameters that are optional for all access types:
<UL>
<LI>
The Expiration parameter specifies a date after which the existence of
the external data is not guaranteed.</LI>

<LI>
The Size parameter specifies the size of the data.</LI>
</UL>
The encapsulated headers in all <TT>Message/External-Body</TT> entities
must include a <TT>Content-ID</TT> header field to give a unique identifier
by which to reference the data.</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Multipart</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates data consisting of multiple body parts, each having its own data
type. It is possible to tell where each body part begins and ends because
each body part is preceded by a special string called an encapsulation
boundary; the last body part is followed by a closing boundary.</DD>


<P>The mandatory parameter <TT>Boundary</TT> specifies the boundary strings
used. The encapsulation boundary is an end of line followed by two hyphens
followed by the boundary parameter value of the <TT>Content-Type</TT> header
field. The closing boundary is the same as the encapsulation boundary with
the addition of two hyphens at the end of the line.

<P>The encapsulation boundary must not appear inside any of the encapsulated
parts. It is crucial that the composing user agent be able to choose and
specify the unique boundary that will separate the body parts. Encapsulation
boundaries may be no longer than 70 characters, not counting the blank
line and leading hyphens.

<P>Thus, a typical multipart <TT>Content-Type</TT> header field might look
like:

<P><TT>Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=gc0y0pkb9ex</TT>

<P>This indicates a body consisting of several body parts, each having
a structure syntactically identical to an <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
message, except that the header area may be completely empty, and each
part is preceded by the line

<P><TT>--gc0y0pkb9ex</TT>

<P>The closing boundary following the last body part indicates that no
further body parts will follow. It is identical to the preceding encapsulation
boundaries, with the addition of two more hyphens at the end of the line:

<P><TT>--gc0y0pkb9ex--</TT>

<P>There is room for additional information before the first encapsulation
boundary and following the final boundary. These areas are often blank.
Anything appearing before the first or after the last boundary is ignored.

<P>As a simple example, the following multipart message has two parts,
both plain text, one explicitly typed and one implicitly typed:
<PRE>From: Nathaniel Borenstein&nbsp;<nsb@bellcore.com>
To: Ned Freed&nbsp;<ned@innosoft.com>
Subject: Sample message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: multipart/mixed;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boundary="simple boundary"

This is the preamble.&nbsp; It is to be ignored, though it is
a handy place for mail composers to include an
explanatory note to non-MIME compliant readers.
--simple boundary

This is implicitly typed plain ASCII text.
--simple boundary
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is explicitly typed plain ASCII text. It DOES end
with a line break.
--simple boundary--
This is the epilogue.&nbsp; It is also to be ignored.</PRE>
The use of a <TT>Content-Type</TT> of multipart in a body part within another
multipart entity is explicitly allowed. In such cases, care must be taken
to ensure that each nested multipart entity uses a different boundary delimiter.

<P>The use of the multipart <TT>Content-Type</TT> with only a single body
part may be useful in certain contexts, and is explicitly permitted.
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Multipart/Mixed</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates multiple independent body parts to be viewed serially.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>Multipart/Alternative</TT></DT>

<DD>
is syntactically identical to <TT>Multipart/Mixed</TT>. Each part is an
"alternative" version of the same information. Mail readers should recognize
that the content of the parts is interchangeable. The mail reader should
either choose the "best" type based on the user's environment and preferences,
or offer the user the available alternatives. Generally, choosing the best
type means displaying only the last part that can be displayed. This may
be used, for example, to send mail in a fancy text format in such a way
that it can easily be displayed anywhere:</DD>

<PRE>From:&nbsp; Nathaniel Borenstein&nbsp;<nsb@bellcore.com>
To: Ned Freed&nbsp;<ned@innosoft.com>
Subject: Formatted text mail
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boundary=boundary42

--boundary42
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

... plain text version of message goes here ...

--boundary42
Content-Type: text/richtext

... richtext version of same message goes here...
--boundary42
Content-Type: text/x-whatever

... fanciest formatted version of same message goes
here
...
--boundary42--</PRE>
In this example, users whose mail system understood <TT>text/x-whatever</TT>
format would see only the fancy version, while other users would see only
the richtext or plain text version, depending on the capabilities of their
system.

<P>Some mail reading programs that recognize more than one of the formats
will offer the user a choice of which format to view. This makes sense
if mail includes both a nicely formatted image version and an easily edited
text version. Multiple versions of the same data should not be not be automatically
shown. The user should wither be shown the last recognized version or explicitly
given the choice.
<DT>
<TT>Multipart/Parallel</TT></DT>

<DD>
is syntactically identical to <TT>Multipart/Mixed</TT>. However, in a parallel
body, all the body parts are intended to be presented simultaneously on
hardware and software that are capable of doing so. Composing agents should
be aware that many mail readers will lack this capability and will show
the parts serially in any event.</DD>


<P><TT>Multipart/Parallel</TT> is likely be used for multimedia messages
that combine such message types as text, audio and/or video.
<DT>
<TT>Multipart/Digest</TT></DT>

<DD>
Indicates that each of the body parts is an <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
mail message. <TT>Multipart/Digest</TT> is syntactically identical to <TT>Multipart/Mixed</TT>,
except that the default <TT>Content-Type</TT> value for a body part is
changed from <TT>Text/Plain</TT> to <TT>Message/Rfc822</TT>.</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Text</TT></DT>

<DD>
The <TT>text</TT> <TT>Content-Type</TT> is for sending material that is
principally textual in form. It is the default <TT>Content-Type</TT>. The
character set of the text can be indicated by using the <TT>Charset</TT>
parameter. The default <TT>Content-Type</TT> for Internet mail is</DD>


<P>Content-Type: text/plain; Charset=US-ASCII.

<P>The value of the Charset parameter is not case sensitive. Allowable
values are US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ... and ISO8859-9. The default
value for Charset is US-ASCII.
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Text/Plain</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates plain (unformatted) text. No special software is required to
get the full meaning of the text, aside from support for the indicated
character set. Other subtypes should be used for enriched text in forms
where application software may enhance the appearance of the text, but
such software must not be required in order to get the general idea of
the content. Possible future subtypes include any readable word processor
format.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>Text/Richtext</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates a simple portable word processing format that is defined by the
MIME standard. It is a very small subset of SGML. Mail readers that implement
Richtext may implement only a subset of it.</DD>


<P>When a mail composing program is given a file in a word processing format
and there is no standardized subtype for that format, then the program
may reformat the file into richtext format which will preserve more of
the original formatting information than reformatting the file to plain
ASCII.</DL>

<DT>
<TT>Video</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates that the body contains a time-varying-picture image, possibly
with color and coordinated sound. The term Video is used very generically
and does not refer to any particular technology or format. It is not meant
to preclude subtypes such as animated drawings encoded compactly.</DD>

<DL>
<DT>
<TT>Video/Mpeg</TT></DT>

<DD>
indicates video coded according to the MPEG standard.</DD>
</DL>

<DT>
<TT>X-<I>TypeName</I></TT></DT>

<DD>
This is any type name that begins with <TT>X-</TT>. A <TT>Content-Type</TT>
value beginning with <TT>X-</TT> is a private value, to be used by consenting
mail systems by mutual agreement. The standard specifies no subtypes.</DD>
</DL>
No type may be specified without a subtype.

<P>The standard allows the use of additional sub-types without having to
change the standard. However, it is important to insure that sub-types
used by different user communities of MIME do not conflict. It would be
confusing if <TT>ContentType: application/foobar</TT> meant two different
things. The standard specifies two mechanisms for defining new <TT>Content-Type</TT>
subtypes:

<P>1. Private values (starting with <TT>X-</TT>) may be defined between
cooperating mail composing and reading programs without outside registration.
Use of this mechanism requires knowing that the reader of the message will
not mistake the content type for something other than originally intended.

<P>2. New standard values must be registered with IANA. Where intended
for public use, the formats they refer to must also be defined by a published
specification.

<P>Messages that do not have a <TT>Content-Type</TT> field in their header
are displayed by user agents as if
<BR><TT>Content-Type: Text/plain; Charset=US-ASCII</TT>
<BR>had been specified.

<P>When a mail reader finds mail with an unknown <TT>Content-Type</TT>
value, it will generally treat it as equivalent to <TT>application/octet-stream</TT>.
<H3>
The Content-Transfer-Encoding Header Field</H3>
Many Content-Types that could usefully be transported by e-mail are represented,
in their "natural" format, as 8-bit character or binary data. Such data
cannot be transmitted over some transport protocols. For example, SMTP
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is an Internet standard for transporting
e-mail defined by a document called <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC821</A>)
restricts mail messages to 7-bit ASCII data with lines no longer than 1000
characters.

<P>MIME provides two mechanisms for re-encoding such data into a 7-bit
short-line format. The Content-Transfer-Encoding header field indicates
the mechanism used to perform such an encoding.

<P>The possible values for the Content-Transfer-Encoding field are:
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>BASE64</TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT>QUOTED-PRINTABLE</TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT>8BIT</TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT>7BIT</TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT>BINARY</TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT>x-EncodingName</TT></LI>
</UL>
These values are not case sensitive: <TT>Base64</TT>, <TT>BASE64</TT> and
<TT>bAsE64</TT> are all equivalent. An encoding type of <TT>7BIT</TT> requires
that the body is already in a 7-bit mail-ready representation. That is
the default value:
<BR><TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7BIT</TT>
<BR>is assumed if the <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT> header field is
not present.

<P>Both <TT>BASE64</TT> and the <TT>QUOTED-PRINTABLE</TT> imply an encoding
that consists of lines no longer than 76 ASCII characters. In other respects
the two encoding schemes are very different.

<P>The encoding scheme implied by <TT>QUOTED-PRINTABLE</TT> is most appropriate
for data that consists primarily of printable ASCII characters. Using this
encoding method, printable ASCII characters are represented as themselves.
The equals sign (=) serves as an escape character. Any character that is
not a printable or white space ASCII character is represented as an equals
sign followed by two hexadecimal digits. An equals sign in the message
is also represented in this way. Lines that are longer than 76 characters
are cut off after the 75th character and the line ends with an equals sign.

<P>The advantages of using the <TT>QUOTED-PRINTABLE</TT> encoding for message

As an example, here is an EDI interchange in <TT>QUOTED-PRINTABLE</TT>

Except for the ISA segment having been wrapped onto two lines, the <TT>QUOTED-PRINTABLE</TT>
encoding of the interchange is identical to its <TT>7BIT</TT> representation.

<P>The <TT>BASE64</TT> encoding mechanism is well suited for representing
binary files. It represents any sequence of three bytes as four printable
ASCII characters. The same interchange as shown above but using the BASE64
encoding would look like:

<TT>BASE64</TT> bears some resemblance to uuencode in both appearance and
function. However, uuencode uses characters that may not be processed properly
by an EBCDIC gateway.

<P>The values <TT>8bit</TT>, <TT>7bit</TT> and <TT>binary</TT> all imply
that no encoding has been performed. They are useful to indicate of the
kind of data contained in the object, and therefore of the kind of encoding
that might need to be performed for transmission in a given transport system.
<TT>7bit</TT> means that the data is all represented as short lines of
ASCII data. <TT>8bit</TT> means that the lines are short, but there may
be non-ASCII characters. <TT>Binary</TT> means that not only may non-ASCII
characters be present, but also that the lines are not necessarily short
enough for SMTP transport.

<P>The difference between <TT>8bit</TT> and <TT>binary</TT> is that <TT>binary</TT>
does not require adherence to any limits on line length. <TT>8bit</TT>
and <TT>binary</TT> are intended for compatibility with future Internet
e-mail transport standards and with gateways to non-Internet environments.
As of this writing, there are no standardized Internet e-mail transports
for which it is legitimate to include unencoded <TT>8-bit</TT> or <TT>binary</TT>
data in mail bodies.

<P>Note that the five values defined for the <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT>
field imply nothing about the <TT>Content-Type</TT> other than the algorithm
by which it was encoded or the transport system requirements if unencoded.

<P>Some implementations may support additional <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT>
values (it is permitted but strongly discouraged by the standard). Any
such additional values must have names that begin with <TT>X-</TT> to indicate
its non-standard status For example:

<P><TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding: x-my-new-encoding.</TT>

<P>If a <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT> header field appears as part
of a message header, it applies to the entire body of that message. If
a <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT> header field appears as part of a
body part's headers, it applies only to the body of that body part. If
a message or body part is of type <TT>Multipart</TT> or <TT>Message</TT>,
the <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT> must be <TT>7bit</TT>, <TT>8bit</TT>
or <TT>Binary</TT>.

<P>The encoding mechanisms defined here explicitly encode all data in ASCII.
Thus, for example, suppose a message or body part has header fields such
as:
<PRE>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: base64</PRE>
This should be interpreted to mean that the body is a Base64 ASCII encoding
of data that was originally in ISO-8859-1, and will be in that character
set again after decoding.
<H3>
Optional Content-ID Header Field</H3>
It may be desirable to allow one body to reference another. Accordingly,
bodies may be labeled using the <TT>Content-ID</TT> header field, which
is syntactically identical to the <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
<TT>Message-ID</TT> header field. <TT>Content-ID</TT> values should be
as unique as possible.

<P>Although the <TT>Content-ID</TT> header is generally optional, its use
is mandatory in headers embedded in a body of type <TT>Message/External-Body</TT>.
<H3>
Optional Content-Description Header Field</H3>
The ability to associate descriptive information with a body is often desirable.
For example, it may be useful to mark an Image body as "a picture of the
Space Shuttle Endeavor." Such text may be placed in the <TT>Content-Description</TT>
header field.
<H3>
Sumary</H3>
Using <TT>MIME-Version</TT>, <TT>Content-Type</TT>, and <TT>Content-Transfer-Encoding</TT>
header fields, it is possible to include arbitrary types of data objects
in <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
conformant mail messages. No restrictions imposed by <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
or <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC822</A>
are violated. MIME has been designed to avoid problems caused by additional
restrictions imposed by some Internet mail transport mechanisms. The <TT>Multipart</TT>
and <TT>Message</TT> content types allow mixing and hierarchical structuring
of objects of different types in a single message. Further content types
provide a mechanism for tagging messages or body parts as audio, image,
or other kinds of data. A parameter syntax allows further specification
of data format details, particularly the specification of alternate character
sets. Additional optional header fields provide mechanisms for certain
extensions deemed desirable by many implementors. Finally, a number of
useful content types are defined for general use by consenting user agents,
notably <TT>Text/Richtext</TT>, <TT>Message/Partial</TT>, and <TT>Message/External-Body</TT>.

<P>To promote interoperability between user agents, the MIME standard specifies
a minimal subset of MIME features a user agent must support to be considered
MIME conformant.
<H3>
A Complex Multipart Example</H3>
The outline of a complex multipart message follows. This message has five
parts to be displayed serially: two introductory plain text parts, an embedded
multipart message, a richtext part, and a closing encapsulated text message
in a non-ASCII character set. The embedded multipart message has two parts
to be displayed in parallel, a picture and an audio fragment.
<PRE>MIME-Version: 1.0

Subject: A multipart example
Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boundary=unique-boundary-1

This is the preamble area of a multipart message.&nbsp; Mail readers
that understand multipart format should ignore this preamble.

If you are reading this text, you might want to consider
changing to a mail reader that understands how to properly
display multipart messages.
--unique-boundary-1

Some text appears here...
[Note that the preceding blank line means
no header fields were given and this is text,
with charset US ASCII.&nbsp; It could have been
done with explicit typing as in the next part.]
--unique-boundary-1
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

This could have been part of the previous part, but illustrates
explicit versus implicit typing of body parts.
