Design Pattern Workshop</H1></CENTER>
When developing software, you encounter a number of recurring problems.
A pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem. Mark Grand, noted
consult and book author is offering a three day workshop on patterns for
object-oriented design. All of the design examples will use the UML notation.
All of the code examples will use Java.
<H2>
Workshop Format</H2>
The workshop will consist of discussions of patterns followed by design
and coding exercises that will incorporate the patterns that were just
discussed.

<BR>All attendees will receive a copy of the book <U>Patterns in Java,
Volume 1</U> by Mark Grand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<H2>
Who Should Attend?</H2>
<B>Software architects and senior programmers</B> will develop a common
vocabulary for discussing design concepts. They will less frequently find
themselves spending an hour debating the merits of an idea with someone,
only to find that they had both had the same idea but were using different
words.&nbsp; In addition to learning new design concepts, they will develop
a better understanding of when to use design concepts they may already
be familiar with

<P><B>Junior and mid-level programmers</B> who are familiar with the basics
of object-oriented design will learn design concepts that it would take
them years to discover on their own. They will also be able to better understand
and implement designs that are given to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Registration</H2>
They next publicly held workshop will be in November 1999 at a location
